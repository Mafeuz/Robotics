# Hexapod Inverse and Forward Kinematics Solutions

* Hexapod Interactive Sim: contains a interactive simulator of the hexapod kinematics using the keyboard keys as a controller. Information
of the solution will be displayed for each position configuration of the robot (x,y,z, rx,ry,rz).

* Hexapod Forward Kin Method: a notebook with the solution for the forward kinematics of a hexapod, based on the use of the Newton Raphson numerical method with the adition of the Hexapod Kin Linear Reg project as initial guess.
